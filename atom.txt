if you get an error when installing/updating an atom package (eg: atom-beautify) saying "SSS Self Signed Certificate"

the run below command and reinstall the package
apm config set strict-ssl false
------------------------------------

to check if atom is installed correctly or not, run (from C:\Users\hp) (your home directory)
apm -v
